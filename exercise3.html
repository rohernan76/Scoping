			Is craneId global or local on line 23? 
			Answer: craneID is set as a variable in the global window. The variable sits outside any functions and or any other local window.

			Why is isViable not global on line 33? 
			Answer: isViable is local because it lies within a function. 
			
			Put into english what makes a "viable" crane by reading through the function isViableCrane
			Answer: If I am reading the statement above correctly, function isViableCrane is "viable" when crane length is greater than crane height.

			Erty's answers:
			Is craneId global or local on line 23? 
			Answer: craneID is instantiated. crandID as a variable gets hoisted up so it's global. 

			Why is isViable not global on line 33? 
			Answer: isViable is local because it lies within a function. As a rule of thumb, put your variables at the top of the function. Example: 

			function isViableCrane(crane) {
			var isViable;
			if (crane[LENGTH] > crane[HEIGHT]) {
				isViable = true;
			} else {
				isViable = false;
			}
			return isViable;
			}
